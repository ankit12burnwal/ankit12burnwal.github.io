# Drum Kit

Description: 
Using DOM, we build a drum kit website. 

Added event listeners to buttons and keystrokes.

There are a number of keys that represent different drums of a drumset as shown below:

When we click on any of the buttons, we get the correspondong sound of the drum. We can also use the keys on the keyboard.
